Introduction
Heart disease is a major global health concern that can have serious implications on individuals' health and quality of life. Early prediction and identification of individuals at risk of heart disease can aid in timely medical intervention and prevention. This project aims to address this challenge using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of medical attributes and features associated with individuals. Each entry in the dataset includes information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. The target variable indicates whether an individual has heart disease (1) or not (0).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before applying machine learning algorithms, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. EDA involved data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between various features and the target variable. EDA helps in understanding data distributions, identifying outliers, and selecting relevant features for training the model.

Machine Learning Algorithms
Several machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project to build and compare predictive models. The algorithms used include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest Regression
Randomized Search Cross-Validation (RandomizedSearchCV)
Each algorithm was trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance their performance.

Results
The project's main objective is to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The trained machine learning models provide binary predictions:

0: Indicates that an individual is unlikely to have heart disease.
1: Indicates that an individual is at risk of heart disease.
The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics are used to assess the performance of the models. These metrics help in understanding the model's ability to correctly predict both positive and negative cases.

Usage
To use the trained models for heart disease prediction, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (if any) mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Use the provided scripts or notebooks to load the dataset, preprocess it, and train the machine learning models.
Once the models are trained, you can input new data and use the models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
